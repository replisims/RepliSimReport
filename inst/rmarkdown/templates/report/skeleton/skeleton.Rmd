\section{Introduction}

This replication report documents the replication attempt of the simulation study `<insert reference of replicated study>`. 
Following the definition of @rougier_sustainable_2017-1 we understand the replication of a published study as writing and running new code based on the description provided in the original publication with the aim of obtaining the same results.

\section{Method}

\subsection{Information basis}

\subsection{Data Generating Mechanism}
Information provided in the above mentioned sources indicated that the following simulation factors were systematically varied in generating the artificial data.

| Simulation factor | No. levels | Levels|
|------|--|-------|
| *Varied*||   
| *Fixed* |||

\subsubsection{Simulation Factor 1}
\subsubsection{Simulation Factor 2}
\subsubsection{Simulation Factor 3}

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
Data generation can be summarized with the following pseudo code:

\texttt{For 1000 repetitions of each of 400 unique scenarios:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*] 
	\item[--] \texttt{Set unique seed based on scenario id and number of repetition.}
	\item[--] \texttt{...}
	\item[--] \texttt{ While some condition < some other condition}
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item[$\ast$] \texttt{Sample ... from the given distribution.}
	  \item[$\ast$] \texttt{Sample a sample size from the given distribution.}
	  \item[$\ast$] \texttt{Compute ... based on these random elements.}
	  \item[$\ast$] \texttt{Determine ... based on mechanism of current scenario.}
	\end{itemize}
	\item[--] \texttt{If some condition is > x:}
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item[$\ast$] \texttt{Determine ... \& resample from corresponding ... model.}
	\end{itemize}
	\item[--] \texttt{Apply ...}
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Compared Methods}
The study compares '<describe the methods that are compared and how they are implemented>'

\subsubsection{Method 1}
'<describe how the first method is defined and implemented. You can include equations and or r code. If applicable mention specialized R packages, their version as well as, parameters of specific functions>'
\subsubsection{Method 2}
'<describe how the second method is defined and implemented>'
'<describe how the first method is defined and implemented. You can include equations and or r code. If applicable mention specialized R packages, their version as well as, parameters of specific functions>'

\subsection{Performance measures}
'<describe which performace measures are compared, if applicable mention specialized R packages, their versions, als well as parameter settings of functions>'
\section{References}

\subsection{Technical implementation}
While the original simulation study was carried out in '<computational environment of original study>' our replication was implemented
using the R programming environment (details regarding software versions can be obtained from the section Reproducibility Information). 
The corresponding R code can be obtained from https://github.com/replisims/your_repo. 
<!-- Add zenodo doi once obtained-->

The following table provides an overview of replicator degrees of freedom, 
i.e. decisions that had to be made by the replicators because of insufficient or contradicting information. 
Issues were resolved by discussion among the replicators. 
Decisions were based on what the replicators perceived to be the most likely implementation with likeliness estimated by common practice and/or guideline recommendations.
Wherever feasible multiple interpretations where implemented.

| Issue| Replicator decision| Justification |
|--------|--------|------|
| Data dependence| each scenario is implemented in independently generated data               | Best practice [@burton_design_2006]|

\subsection{Code organization}

The code and the files associated are organized in the form of a research compendium
which can be found in the following git repository `https://github.com/replisims/your_repo`


\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
```{r code_structure, cache = FALSE}
# which R packages and versions?
if ("fs" %in% installed.packages()) fs::dir_tree(path = ".", recurse = TRUE)
```
\end{minipage}

\subsubsection{Reproducibility Information}

This report was last updated on `r Sys.time()`. 
The simulation replication was conducted using the following computational environment and dependencies: 

\FloatBarrier
```{r colophon, cache = FALSE}
# which R packages and versions?
if ("devtools" %in% installed.packages()) devtools::session_info()
```

The current Git commit details are:

```{r git}
# what commit is this file at? 
if ("git2r" %in% installed.packages() & git2r::in_repository(path = ".")) git2r::repository(here::here())  
```
